Completed February 2019
Small academic project, my first project using C++.
Simulates an emergency room queue and reports data about patient visitation.

Usage:
Compile with "make"
Run with "Run test10.txt"

The main class initially calls the FileHandler to open the file then the EDSimulation to initialize the simulation.
The initiate() function then creates the first Arrival which starts the simulation, creating all other events thereafter.
